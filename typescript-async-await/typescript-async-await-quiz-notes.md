## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the `async` and `await` keywords used for?
  async: declares a function that always returns a Promise
  await: indicates that JS Runtime should "wait" or "pause" until the asynchronous (Promise) function completes

  make it look more synchronous and readable

- How do `async` and `await` differ from `Promise.then` and `Promise.catch`?
  cleaner, more synchronous appearance, handles sequential code naturally, better for modern environments

  they use Promises but the syntax is different, execution appears to pause until the Promise resolves, its stalling essentially until what you need to load loads.

- When do you use `async`?
  used to declare a function that'll handle asynchronous operations, ensures the function returns a Promise

- When do you use `await`? When do you _not_ use `await`? (What happens if you `await` a synchronous function?)

  use: to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise resolves
  do not use: when calling a synchronous function, when you don't need to wait for the result immediately (fire-and-forget tasks)

  if you 'await' a synch function it'll still work but it adds unnecessary overhead since there's no Promise to resolve

- How do you handle errors with `await`?
  wrap await calls in a try block and handle errors in a catch block
  EX:
  try {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com');
  if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
  }
  return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
  console.error('Fetch error:', error);
  }

- What do `try`, `catch` and `throw` do? When do you use them?
  try: attempts to execute the code in its block
  catch: the code to execute if an error occurs in the try block
  throw: manually creates and throws an error to be handled by catch

- What happens if you forget to use `await` on a Promise? In that case, what happens to the Promise rejection?

  the function will proceed without waiting for the Promise to resolve, often leading to logic errors or undefined values (its pending state)
  if we don't use await we wont have a way to know if the Promise went through, we'd be accessing it in its pending state

- Which style of asynchronous programming do you prefer â€” callbacks, `Promise.then`, or `async/await`? Why?

  async/await because readability, reduced nesting, error handling, modern standards

  however, Promise.then is still useful for chaining multiple independent Promises, and callbacks can be necessary when working with legacy APIs.
