## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Give 6 examples of comparison operators.
  equal (==): returns true if operands are equal
  not equal (!=):
  strict equal (===)
  strict not equal (!==)
  greater than (>)
  less than (<): returns true if left operand is less than right

- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?
  boolean data types

- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
  most simple, use if when you need to add some sort of conditional expression, followed by a code block to execute if that condition is true or not

- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?
  no, they are optional, but it is a way to handle the opposite condition

- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.
  if(boolean expression){

}
the conditional expression will always evaluate to either a true or false

- What are the three logical operators?
  logical AND (&&): returns true if both operands are true
  logical OR (||): returns true if at least one of the operands is true
  logical NOT (!): returns false if operand is true and true if operand is false (reverse)

- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?
  by using logical operators

- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
  useful for a collection of conditions/cases that need to be check against (could be don't technically with an else/if but switch is more succinct)

- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?
  no, it is optional, but it is a nice way to handle a final catch all just in case previous clauses were not executed
