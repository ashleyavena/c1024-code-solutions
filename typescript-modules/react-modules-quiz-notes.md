## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are modules?
  a collection of code in an external file which performs a specific task or function, able to divide a program into multiple files and access them using import/export

- What is the difference between named and default imports?

- What is the difference between named and default exports?
  Unlike default exports, a module can have multiple named exports since they all have their own unique names.

default export: allows the content of whats being exported to be named in the file that is importing it. it allows you to give any name to the module thats being imported
each module can have 1 default export
Named exports & imports maintain the name of the entity being exported from one module & imported to another
