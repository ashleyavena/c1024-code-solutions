Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  a specific screen width at which the layout of a website changes to better fir the screen size, defined in CSS with @media queries usually

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  percent widths enable elements to resize proportionally with the screen, allows the layout to be more flexible and adaptive across various screen sizes

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  because of source order, aka cascade order, if they have the same styles the one that comes last in order will effectively win
